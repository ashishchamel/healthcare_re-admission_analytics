-------------------------------------------
WHY RAW DATA IS NOT INCLUDED (IF PUBLIC)
-------------------------------------------
The full raw dataset used in this project may not be included in the public GitHub repository for the following reasons:
1. The dataset is large (~50–100 MB) and exceeds GitHub’s size limits for version control.
2. It contains potentially sensitive or semi-identifiable clinical records.
3. Licensing restrictions may apply to hospital readmission datasets.

-------------------------------------------
HOW TO ACCESS OR REPRODUCE THE DATA
-------------------------------------------
If you wish to reproduce this analysis:

Option 1 — Request Access:
- Contact the author (Ashish Chamel) via LinkedIn or GitHub to request the cleaned dataset sample.
- A sanitized subset (10k–20k rows) can be shared for academic or demonstration use.

Option 2 — Use a Public Equivalent:
- You can download a similar dataset from Kaggle:  
  🔗 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/diabetes
- Rename the downloaded file as `healthcare_raw.csv` and place it in:
  `data/raw/`

Option 3 — Regenerate from Notebook:
- The notebook `python/healthcare_eda_feature_engineering.ipynb` includes
  preprocessing and cleaning steps that can be applied to the Kaggle dataset
  to recreate this version.

-------------------------------------------
REPRODUCIBILITY
-------------------------------------------
After placing the dataset in the correct path, run the following order:
1. Execute SQL script: `sql/sql_healthcare_readmission.sql` to load and clean.
2. Run Python notebook: `python/healthcare_eda_feature_engineering.ipynb` to process features.
3. Export Tableau-ready data: `data/processed/healthcare_processed.csv`.
