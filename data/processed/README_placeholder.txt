This folder contains the **processed version** of the healthcare readmission dataset used
for exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and visualization.

The main processed file in this project:
- `healthcare_processed.csv` ‚Üí Tableau-ready export generated after Python preprocessing.

-------------------------------------------
CREATION WORKFLOW
-------------------------------------------
1. The raw dataset (`healthcare_raw.csv`) was cleaned and loaded into SQL for basic filtering.
2. Cleaned records were exported from MySQL into Python via Pandas.
3. Feature engineering and transformations were applied in:
   - `python/healthcare_eda_feature_engineering.ipynb`
4. The final processed file was exported as `healthcare_processed.csv`.

DATA CHARACTERISTICS
-------------------------------------------
- Contains no missing or null values.
- All categorical fields encoded and standardized.
- Numerical variables normalized/scaled where applicable.
- Target variable `readmit_30d` retained as binary label.
- Columns renamed for clarity and compatibility with Tableau.
