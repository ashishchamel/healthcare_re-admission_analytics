ü©∫ Project: Healthcare Readmission Analytics
üéØ Purpose: Document AI-assisted code or documentation generation for transparency.

-------------------------------------------
AI / PROMPT USAGE SUMMARY
-------------------------------------------
Some components of this project were refined with AI assistance (ChatGPT, GPT-5)
for documentation and template generation. All analytical logic, data cleaning, and 
feature engineering steps were verified manually.

Examples of prompts used:
1Ô∏è‚É£  "Generate a clean Python function to categorize A1C and glucose values for healthcare data."
2Ô∏è‚É£  "Write a recruiter-friendly README for a data analytics project using Excel, SQL, Python, and Tableau."
3Ô∏è‚É£  "Summarize the dataset schema for a healthcare readmission analysis."
4Ô∏è‚É£  "Create a professional GitHub repository structure and data folder READMEs."

-------------------------------------------
HUMAN REVIEW & VALIDATION
-------------------------------------------
- All code produced or suggested by AI was reviewed, debugged, and tested manually.
- Business insights, KPI definitions, and SQL logic are original contributions.
- The final README and dataset documentation were edited for accuracy and tone.
